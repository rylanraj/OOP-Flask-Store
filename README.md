# OOP-Flask-Store

_For my Object Oriented Programming class at BCIT_

## Overview

OOP-Flask-Store is a web application built with Python and Flask that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in a practical, web-based project. The project simulates an online store and is intended as a learning exercise for OOP principles, Flask routing, and template rendering.

## Features

- Object-oriented design for store entities (e.g., products, users, carts)
- Flask-powered web backend
- HTML templates for dynamic front-end rendering
- Modular Python codebase for maintainability and extensibility
- Example data and basic CRUD operations
